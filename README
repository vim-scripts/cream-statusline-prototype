Toggles the display of the current function prototype on the statusline with key <F8>. This is a basic illustration of how to write code to accomplish this...feel free to embellish!


USAGE

By default, the <F8> key will toggle the display of the current prototype in the statusline. The prototype is recalculated each time it is toggled ON.


This is one of many custom utilities and functions for gVim from the Cream project (http://cream.sourceforge.net), a configuration of Vim for those of us familiar with Apple and Windows software.
